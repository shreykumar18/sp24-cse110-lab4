## Question 13

A - '32' in this case the + sign is used for concatenation
B - '1' there will just be subtraction as that is what the - sign is for
C - '3' as in the addition null = 0
D - '3null' in this case there is a concatenation of a string and null gets converted to a string
E - '4' as there is addition and true = 1
F - '0' as there is addition and both false and null = 0
G - '3undefined' as the undefined is converted to a string and there is a concatenation of 2 strings
H - 'NaN' this is because ther esult of the subtraction cant be of a number and one that cant be converted to a number which is undefined, so the resukt us not a number

## Question 14

A - 'true' as they are both taken as numbers and compared
B - 'false' as they are both compared with unicode values and 2 is greater.
C - 'true' as 2 is converted to a number and they are both equal.
D - 'false' as the === operator compares without conversion and they are both different types so they aren't equal
E - 'false' as true is converted to 1 and the 2 numbers arent equal
F - 'true' as both evaluate to true which are strictly equal.

## Question 15

The difference between the == and === operator is that the == is a loose equality as it will convert the types to make them the same type and then compare them whereas === is strict equality and wont convert types to compare for equality and will take the values at face value.
