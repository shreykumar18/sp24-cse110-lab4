# Part 1

## Question 1

The output from this line will be 'values added: ' and then the result which is the sum of num1 and num2 depending on the values. 'values added: 20'

## Question 2

'final result: 20'

## Question 3

'values added: 20'

## Question 4

There will be an error as the let declaration will only allow the use of result in its own block due to block scope

## Question 5

There will be an error as there is an assingment to a constant variable which isn't allowed.

## Question 6

There will be an error as well as regardless the const variable is trying to be changed and there is no code to catch this error.

# Part 2

## Question 1

3 will be logged onto the console as i will have the same value as prices.length after the loop.

## Question 2

150 will be logged as the discounted price of the last element in the array which is 300, and half of that is 150.

## Question 3

150.00 will be logged again as the last discounted price rounded to 2 decimal places will be the final price that is logged.

## Question 4

[50, 100, 150] will be returned as it will be the discounted array in which each value in the input will get discounted which is 0.5

## Question 5

There will be an error as i is not defined in the scope and due to block scope that comes with let declaration it wont be accessible

## Question 6

There will be an error as discountedPrice is not defined in the scope and due to block scope that comes with let declaration it wont be accessible

## Question 7

150 will be logged at the line as finalPrice with let declaration has function scope.

## Question 8

Again the [50, 100, 150] will logged even with let declaration as its not affected as everything is added to the array within the block scope for the discounted price variable.

## Question 9

There will be an error as i is let declared and when tried to log into console outside the loop there will be an error

## Question 10

3 will be logged as that is the length of the array and length was declared within the block scope of the function.

## Question 11

Again the function will perfectly and return the array [50, 100, 150] as all variables when used are within their respective scopes and will retrieve the discounted prices of all the items.
